This is a Typo Sidebar plugin that renders github badges in typo blogs. 
Currently supported GitHub badges are: 

Dr Nic's badge: 
	http://drnicjavascript.rubyforge.org/github_badge/

YAGHB: 
	Yet Another Github Badge 
	Good for typo users who have themes that don't work well with Dr Nic's badge.

Add it to typo like so: 

cd typo/vendor/plugins
git clone git://github.com/peteonrails/githubsidebar.git github_sidebar
